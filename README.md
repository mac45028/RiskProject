# RiskProject

Goals:

The goal of this project is to implement the back-testing platform for signed option trading 

stategy. In the current state, it can only perform the assigned strategy only. The project is 

implemented in Java.

Result:

The trading platform work as planned and this trading strategy is not quite profitable for day-trading.

However, weekly trading is good enough(before fees).

Todo:

Planned to add the ability to add other strategy to be tested based on config file and integrated with

Maven and Junit.
